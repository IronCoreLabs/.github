IronCore Labs makes usable, searchable application-layer encryption that helps developers and security teams lock down their sensitive cloud and AI data while keeping it usable.

## The application-layer encryption platform

![platform diagram](/images/ironcore-platform.png)

The [IronCore SaaS Shield platform](https://ironcorelabs.com/products/saas-shield/) helps encrypt and manage data, regardless of data store, taking care of all of the difficult concerns of security, scalability, key orchestration, and smokin' fast performance. Together with [Cloaked Search](https://ironcorelabs.com/products/cloaked-search/) and [Cloaked AI](https://ironcorelabs.com/products/cloaked-ai/), it keeps that data usable, findable, and secure even from the servers and services that hold the data.

For SaaS apps, supports per-tenant encryption and key management with options for BYOK/HYOK, real-time audit trails direct to customers, and more. It can connect to all of the major KMSes with per tenant keys. And no sensitive data flows through IronCore, ever.

## Groundbreaking AI data protection

[IronCore's Cloaked AI](https://ironcorelabs.com/products/cloaked-ai/) product uses property-preserving encryption that maintains the distance relationships between vectors while encrypting them, allowing organizations to perform nearest neighbor searches, clustering, and anomaly detection over encrypted AI data and to build models over encrypted embeddings that require a key to use. 

The encryption technique is based on the paper, "", and utilizes the scale and perturb algorithm, which randomly adds noise and redistributes vectors while preserving relative distances. Read more about the [security of AI embeddings](https://ironcorelabs.com/ai-encryption/).

We believe in transparency and we talk openly about our choice of algorithms and our implementations. Most of our source code is open source and we invite security and crypto researchers to check it out.

Note: the open source licenses are mostly AGPL so if you plan to use it in commercial or non-GPL software, you'll need an inexpensive commercial license.

### SaaS Shield

Our client libraries are open source and can be found in our per-language `tenant-security-client` repos: [![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/go-%2300ADD8.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-go), [![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-java), [![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-nodejs), [![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-php).

We have a public [demo application](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/saas-shield-demo-notes-app) showing SaaS Shield with our S3 Proxy, Cloaked AI and Cloaked Search.

### Cloaked AI

We're in the process of building out a single unified library that generates interfaces for various languages.  It has most of the functionality of the `tenant-security-clients` and also contains all of the Cloaked AI vector encryption functionality. That's all in our [ironcore-alloy](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/ironcore-alloy) repo, which is written in Rust and is currently published to ![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/java-%23ED8B00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=openjdk&logoColor=white), ![Kotlin](https://img.shields.io/badge/kotlin-%237F52FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=kotlin&logoColor=white), ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54), and ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white) libraries.

### Cloaked Search

We have a public repo that lets anyone quickly get started using a docker container and test data: [Try Cloaked Search](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/try-cloaked-search).

We also have public benchmarks and published approaches to performance testing: [Cloaked Search Perf](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/cloaked-search-perf).

### Data Control Platform

The Data Control Platform (DCP) lets developers build access controls directly into their data, regardless of where it's stored. It is particularly good for end-to-end encryption use cases.

This platform uses a proxy re-encryption algorithm (we call it [transform encryption in our docs](https://ironcorelabs.com/docs/data-control-platform/concepts/transform-encryption/)) to encrypt to a public key, then delegate decryption rights to other public keys. DCP enables the ability to encrypt to a group key and have group administrator(s) add or remove members at any time, effectively granting and revoking access to data that's encrypted to the group's public key.

> The details can be found in the ACM paper [Cryptographically Enforced Orthogonal Access Control at Scale](https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N654085).

The key libraries are audited and we have extensive documentation.
